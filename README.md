Staker Ecosystem Club
The Staker Ecosystem Club is a utility-based NFT DAO through Syndicate that aims to pool capital and make investment decisions together to enable the vibrant future of decentralized finance. 

The Staker Ecosystem Club aims to bring together the “cross-chain intelligence” within the Web3 Investment Club. The Ecosystem Growth Committee will give its Members the ability to develop and deploy investment strategies within the StakerDAO ecosystem, according to the Syndicate Guide.

Once the Staker Genesis Membership NFTs are purchased, the Staker Ecosystem Club could evolve in several different directions. Members have the right to pool capital and make investments together. The direction is up to the Members.
